**SINGLE-CELL ISO-SEQ WORKFLOW**
- Compatible with any full-length single-cell platform
- Detailed workflow guidance
- Standard Iso-Seq library preparation & sequencing
workflow
- Can generate matching short read data from same
sample
- ~3 million HiFi reads per SMRT Cell 8M
- Flexible barcoding & multiplexing based on desired
number of reads per cell

**COMBINING SHORT- AND LONG-READ SINGLE CELL DATA**

- Short read data identifies cell clusters
- Long read data identifies full-length isoforms
- Matching (UMI, BC) links isoforms to cell types

**Human influenza infections are initiated by just a few virions**

1. We take many cells, and infect them with many virions
2. We usually average over this entire process to study infection
3. We infect A549 cells at low multiplicity of infection (MOI)
4. This yields a large cell-gene matrix that we cananalyze computationally
  - Extreme variation across single cells
5. I said that we used a stock of "wildtype” virus. Actually, all viral stocks contain mutants. Maybe mutations in the virions explain
variation across cells…

Single-cell transcriptomics counts mRNAs, it doesn’t tell us if they have mutations


We start with the same process as forsingle-cell transcriptomics
But we also perform full-length PacBio sequencing on viral genes

Cells infected by wildtype virions often produce lots of viral mRNA
